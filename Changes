Revision history for Perl extension Text::Balanced::Marpa.

1.05  2015-01-09T17:45:12
	- Move tree2string(), and all the methods it uses - node2string(), format_node() and
		hashref2string() -, into the Tree V 1.06 class. This means that all the code which used to
		use $parser -> tree2string now needs to use $parser -> tree -> tree2string.

1.04  2015-01-08T08:03:38
	- One of the error/warning messages was in single-quotes, but had to support interpolation.

1.03  2015-01-06T08:57:35
	- No code changes.
	- Expand the explanation in the FAQ as to why you can't call escape_char(), open() or close()
		after calling new().
	- Add xt/author/changes.t.
	- Reformat datestamps in this file, so I can use Test::CPAN::Changes in xt/author/changes.t.
	- Fix typo in URL link in docs.
	- Remove reduntant code.
	- Clean up docs.
	- Add examples/jdurand.01.pl.

1.02  2014-12-31 11:10:00
	- Change the default value for text() from '' to \''. That was a typo fix.
	- Add the length() and pos() mutators, to allow the user to control the call to the recognizer's
		read() method. See the FAQ.
	- Add the exhaustion_is_fatal option. See error_number() == 6 for details.
	- Add t/skip.prefix.t to demonstrate pos() and length().
	- Add scripts/tiny.pl for quick tests without Test::More.
	- Add the escape_char() mutator, to allow the user to overrider the default escape char.
	- Add t/non.default.escapes.t to demonstrate escape_char().
	- Add more error numbers, corresponding the 'die's which were not previously consistent with the
		way error_numbers and error_messages should be set.
	- Comment explicitly all 'die's within the scope of try{} catch{}, and visa versa. This affects
		how 'Error: ' is only added once to error messages being printed.

1.01  2014-12-29 08:41:00
	- Stop including the string 'Error: ' twice in error messages.
	- Stop the option print_warnings from printing the tree. Leave that to the caller.
	- Change docs to match.
	- Change scripts/*.pl and t/*.t to match.
	- Change the output of tree2string() where there was an extra vertical dash at the start of the
		last line in some cases (which the original code in Tree::DAG_Node did not print).
	- Clean up the docs.
	- Rename t/parenthises.t to t/parentheses.t.

1.00  2014-12-24 09:52:00
	- Original version
